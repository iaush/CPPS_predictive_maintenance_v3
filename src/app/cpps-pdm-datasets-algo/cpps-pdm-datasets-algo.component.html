                        <p>
                            The difference between them is that deep learning is learning from a training set and then applying that learning to a new data set, while reinforcement learning is dynamically learning by adjusting actions based in continuous feedback to maximize a reward.

                        <ol>
                            <li>Traditional RL algorithms wherein an agent learns from reward, our algorithm learns a mapping from desired rewards and observations to actions.</li>
                            <li>Our algorithm includes two parallel algorithms: 1) A1 performs execution and exploration and 2) A2 performs supervised learning. A1 generates actions based on known maximum possible cumulative rewards using the current version of the model trained by A2.                             </li>
                            <li>For the sake of exploration, random actions are taken occasionally. The observations, actions and rewards are saved in a buffer. A2 uses historical data that is extracted from the buffer to train the model that maps the observation and maximum possible cumulative rewards to optimal action.                            </li>
                            <li>Relying purely on offline data makes offline RL a perfect choice for maintenance decision-making wherein storing historical data to learn a policy is much more cost-effective than developing a simulator that can model the problem accurately.                            </li>
